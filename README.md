## Development
The package is still under development and we welcome your contributions. To start with
development, create a virtual python environment and activate it. Then install the current
package with its `dev` dependencies in editable mode. The following commands can be used
for this.

```sh
python3.9 -m venv .pyenv
source .pyenv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure your Python version is >=3.9
